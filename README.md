# Keyword extraction for Zotero
This tool was developed to extract keywords from files in Zotero's storage. Right now, it only includes pdf files and the most recent version is inside the single/ folder. Folder contents are described below:

- batch: Meant to be used to batch process all pdf files inside Zotero's storage. Expect it to be deprecated soon, in favor of the single (on demand) process for each Zotero register in its storage.
- single: Most recent version; it only extracts keywords for pdf files associated to a given id.
